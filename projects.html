                    This is a website I created for a Baitshop. The project here was to redesign a website
                    that had been made with little effort. I started this project from scratch with no code 
                    to start with.

                <p>
                    My Fitness Club website was a project I did for a made up fitness center. I was tasked with creating
                    a website that showed off pictures of the facility, provided info on classes, and contained a form 
                    that a potential customer would fill out to be contacted. This website was also built from scratch.

                <p>
                    The Travel Destination is another website I built from scratch. The purpose of this website was to inform
                    a tourist on why Destin Florida would be a good destination for vacation.
