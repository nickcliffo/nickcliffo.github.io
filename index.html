                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>
                My name is Nicholas Clifford and I am 24 years old. I was born in May of 2000 in Joplin MO.
                I graduated High School in May of 2018 receiving my High School diploma. After graduating, I started
                my college journey in CIS. I plan on graduating from college in Fall of 2025.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I have many different hobbies that I enjoy including, fishing, 3d printing, and gaming. Almost every
                weekend
                you will find me out fishing a pond or river. I mostly enjoy fishing because all of my other hobbies are
                indoors
                so fishing gets me outside to soak up the sun! I also enjoy 3d printing. I got into 3d printing because
                it looked cool
                but, it also is awesome to be able to creeate things in a CAD software and send it to the printer to
                bring it to life!
                Lastly, I enjoy gaming. Not just the gaming part but building gaming computers to play on. I have built
                many gaming PCs for
                friends and family and have enjoyed every second of it.
